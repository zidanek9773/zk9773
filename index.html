    How the teams logos were created
Arsenal Arsenal's club badge famously features a cannon. Why? The team started out in 1886 as Dial Square FC, a group of munitions workers at Woolwich's Royal Arsenal factory. With their first crest in 1905, the club borrowed heavily from the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich — in this first incarnation, three gun barrels stuck out the top of three lions' heads, looking like an early attempt at a weapon of mass destruction. The logo, of course, also explains the club's nickname as 'The Gooners', a derivation of 'Gunners'.

Liverpool the Liverpool emblem is one of the most iconic symbols of the Premier League, instantly gaining recognition from soccer fans worldwide. Initially, the emblem had a significant resemblance to the coat of arms of Liverpool, on which the central figure of the coat of arms was the Roman god Neptune.
Like many symbols that have stood the test of time, the emblem has changed to resonate with its audience. The coat of arms depicts a bright red feather bird gracefully set within a pronounced shield. This bird, deeply connected to the city’s history, has become synonymous with the soccer club.

Manchester unitedManchester United Football Club, hailing from the Old Trafford area of Greater Manchester, is a distinct and formidable figure in the soccer world. Despite sharing geographical roots with Manchester City, they are very different clubs, each with its rich historical legacies. Manchester United, colloquially referred to as the Red Devils traces its history back to 1878 when it was known as Newton Heath LYR Football Club.
Manchester United has risen to prominence amongst the elite, winning 20 league titles. This feat puts them at the pinnacle of English soccer, and they share the honor of the joint record for the most league wins.
